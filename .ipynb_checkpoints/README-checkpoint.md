# LSTM_Stock_Predictor_Deep_Learning
Deep Learning Models

In this project I have been asked to help build and evaluate deep learning models to provide trading signals for cryptocurrencies.

I will be exploring deep learning on Bitcoin through recurrent neural networks.  The goals of this project are as follows.

1)Prepare data to train & test models
2)Build and train custom LSTM RNNs
3)Evaluate the performance of each model

After evaluation and analysis of the model I will provide insight for the reader on comparison & performance.

Evaluating the performance of each Model.

1) Which model has the lower loss?
Closing Price Model.

2) Which model tracks the actual values better over time? 
Closing Price Model.

3) Which window size works best for the model?
I ran a few different window sizes for the FNG model and was able to lower the loss using Widnow size = 2.
