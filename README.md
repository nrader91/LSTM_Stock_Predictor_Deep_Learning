Deep Learning Models

In this project I have been asked to help build and evaluate deep learning models to provide trading signals for cryptocurrencies.

I will be exploring deep learning on Bitcoin through recurrent neural networks.  The goals of this project are as follows.

1)Prepare data to train & test models
2)Build and train custom LSTM RNNs
3)Evaluate the performance of each model

After evaluation and analysis of the model I will provide insight for the reader on comparison & performance.
